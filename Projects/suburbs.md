## Gentrification, Displacement, and "Social Cleansing" in the Atlanta Suburbs
I grew up in the Atlanta suburbs. Some time around 2014, I noticed that an apartment complex I had regularly passed since I was a child was being torn down. I dug into the matter further and discovered that this was but one instance of a region-wide phenomenon. City councils across Atlanta's northern suburbs were approving plans to tear down older residences to make way for upscale "in-town" communities. These developments often followed New Urbanist design principles, and local officials championed their potential to reverse the tides of suburban disinvestment hastened by the Great Recession. Central to these efforts was the destruction of thousands of relatively affordable apartment units that housed a large portion of the region's Hispanic population. The economic development plan, it would seem, was to replace one set of people with another. In the prescient words of Neil Smith, municipal suburban governments across the region appeared to be carrying out a ["social cleansing strategy."](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9780429242670-9/postfascist-sub-urbanism-scott-markley-coleman-allums)

The map below shows the locations of apartment demolitions between 2010 and 2017 across five suburban municipalities north of Atlanta: Brookhaven, Sandy Springs, Roswell, Smyrna, and Marietta. The size of the dots corresponds with the number of people living in the apartments before demolition. Clicking on a dot will show the racial/ethnic breakdown of that apartment's residents, while clicking on a city boundary will show this information for that city in 2010 and 2020. Zooming into a demolition site will display a recent satellite image showing what is currently in that spot.

The racial/ethnic breakdown of displaced residents is also shown in the chart below. Over 9,000 people lived in the 18 apartment complexes that were bulldozed. Of those displaced, 59 percent were Hispanic and 29 percent were Black in a region where Hispanic and Black residents each comprised less than 20 percent of the total population at the time of demolition.
