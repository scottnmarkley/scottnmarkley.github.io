title: Gentrification, Displacement, and "Social Cleansing" in the Atlanta Suburbs
---

I grew up in the Atlanta suburbs. Some time around 2014, I noticed that an apartment complex that I had regularly passed since I was a child was being torn down. I dug into the matter more and discovered that this was but one instance of a region-wide phenomenon. City councils across Atlanta's northern suburbs were approving plans to tear down older residences to make way for upscale "in-town" communities. These developments often followed New Urbanist design principles, and local officials championed their potential to reverse the tides of suburban disinvestment hastened by the Great Recession. entral to these efforts was the destruction of thousands of relatively affordable apartment units that housed a large portion of the region's Hispanic population. The economic development plan, it would seem, was to replace one set of people with another. In the prescient words of Neil Smith, municipal governments across the region appeared to be engaged in a "social cleansing strategy."

The map below shows the locations of apartment demolitions between 2010 and 2017 across five suburban municipalities north of Atlanta: Brookhaven, Sandy Springs, Roswell, Smyrna, and Marietta. The size of the dots corresponds with the estimated number of people living in the apartments before demolition. Clicking on a dot will show the estimated racial/ethnic breakdown of the residents.

In my earliest work as part of this overall project, I dug into that first case I noticed: the Frazier Street Apartments in Roswell. This work appeared in *Southeastern Geographer*[https://www.jstor.org/stable/26233815].
