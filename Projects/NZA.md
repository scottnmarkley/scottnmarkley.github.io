Since the beginning of 2023, I have served as the Geospatial Project Coordinator for the [National Zoning Atlas (NZA)](https://www.zoningatlas.org/), a research collaborative based at Cornell University that is building the most extensive, detailed, and reliable repository of standardized zoning data in the US. So far, our group has collected, digitized, and mapped zoning information for over 5,000 jurisdictions covering over 110 million people across the country. Check it out below.

### Zoning Snapshots
In addition to helping build the Atlas, I have also helped generate the NZA's [Zoning Snapshot series](https://www.zoningatlas.org/snapshots). These data visualizations summarize how zoning rules like allowed unit densities, minimum lot sizes, accessory dwelling unit allowances, and minimum parking requirements break down across jurisdictions within metropolitan regions. For example, looking at the snapshot for Metro Austin, Texas below, we can see that across Metro Austin's 54 jurisdictions with zoning authority, only 15 percent of the land area is subject to zoning regulations. And within that portion, we can see that a plurality of land is designated for mixed residential and non-residential uses.

Further below, this snapshot shows that while 64 percent of the zoned land allows single-family housing units by right, only 17 percent allows four or more units by right.
