title: Historical Housing and Urbanization Project
---

In this project, my colleagues (Steve Holloway, Taylor Hafley, and Mathew Hauer) and I have constructed a database that contains historical housing unit and urbanization estimates in consistent 2010 census tract boundaries. These data are provided for every tract in the Continental US from 1940 to 2019. Once published, this dataset can be used to analyze the historical geographies of housing loss and gain, urban renewal, (sub)urbanization, and more. This database&mdash;and the R and python code used to construct it&mdash;will hopefully be out of peer review and available soon. Check back with this page for updates!

The gif below uses our dataset to depict suburbanization through time in the Atlanta region. Once a tract surpasses 200 housing units per dasymetrically refined square mile&mdash;*i.e.*, the tract surface area minus water, parks, airports, cemeteries, and railyards&mdash;we consider it "urban."
