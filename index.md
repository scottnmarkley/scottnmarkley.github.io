I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Geography](https://geography.uga.edu/) at the University of Georgia. My research broadly focuses on questions at the intersection of urban geography and racial capitalism. This frequently involves multi-method investigations into housing segregation and the racially uneven geographies of sub/urban development. I also like to produce GIS data products that assist researchers and organizations working on similar questions.

My current project situates the Home Owners' Loan Corporation's (HOLC) so-called "redlining" mapping program within the longer histories of racial capitalism. As part of this effort, I have tabulated the variables in their "Area Description" sheets and made this richly detailed historical data available for [download](https://osf.io/qytj8/). Users can access the R code [here](https://github.com/snmarkley1/HOLC_ADS).

Please feel free to contact me if you have questions about this work.
