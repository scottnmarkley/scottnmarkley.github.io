I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Geography](https://geography.uga.edu/) at the University of Georgia. My research focuses on questions at the intersection of sub/urban geography and racial capitalism. This frequently involves multi-method investigations into housing segregation and the racially uneven geographies of sub/urban development. I also like to produce GIS data products that assist researchers and organizations working on similar questions.

My current project looks into the federal, New Deal-era ["redlining" mapping program](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=4/40.886/-105.499&text=intro) operated by the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC). You can read about this work [here](https://snmarkley1.github.io/Projects/HOLC/). As part of this effort, I have tabulated the variables in the HOLC maps' "Area Description" sheets and made the tables, GIS files, code, and write-up available for download at [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/qytj8/). Check out the interactive map below!

Zoom into a city and click on one of its HOLC neighborhoods to see its attributes. You can toggle the basemap by clicking the layer icon on the lefthand side. All variables used to populate these attribute tables are available [here]().
