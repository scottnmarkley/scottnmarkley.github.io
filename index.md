I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Geography](https://geography.uga.edu/) at the University of Georgia. My research focuses on questions at the intersection of urban geography and racial capitalism. This frequently involves multi-method investigations into housing segregation and the racially uneven geographies of sub/urban development. I also like to produce GIS data products that assist researchers and organizations working on similar questions.

My current project looks into the federal, New Deal-era ["redlining" mapping program](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=4/40.886/-105.499&text=intro) operated by the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC). Specifically, I position this program within the longer histories of racial capitalism and highlight their role in tightening the bonds linking race and economic value together in geographic space. As part of this effort, I have tabulated the variables in the maps' accompanying "Area Description" sheets. I have made this richly detailed historical data available for [download](https://osf.io/qytj8/). Users can access the R code [here](https://github.com/snmarkley1/HOLC_ADS).

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about this work.
