I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Geography](https://geography.uga.edu/) at the University of Georgia. My research focuses on questions at the intersection of sub/urban geography, racial capitalism, and Geographic Information Science (GIS). This frequently involves multi-method investigations into housing segregation and the racially uneven geographies of sub/urban development. For an example of this work, see this recent article in the [*International Journal of Urban and Regional Research*](https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-2427.12873). 

I also like to produce GIS data products that assist researchers and organizations working on similar questions. For example, a recent project of mine out now in *Nature*'s [*Scientific Data*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01184-x) has released historical housing unit, urbanization, and land-use data in consistent census tract boundaries from 1940 to 2019 for the Continental US. This data product&mdash;called the Historical Housing Unit and Urbanization Dataset v2010, or [HHUUD10](https://osf.io/fzv5e/)&mdash;allows users to investigate the historical geographies of urban renewal, housing unit loss and gain, and sub/urbanization. You can more about it [here](https://snmarkley1.github.io/Projects/HHUUD10/).

My current project looks into the federal, New Deal-era ["redlining" mapping program](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=4/40.886/-105.499&text=intro) operated by the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC). You can read about this work [here](https://snmarkley1.github.io/Projects/HOLC/). As part of this effort, I have tabulated the variables in the HOLC maps' "Area Description" sheets and made the tables, GIS files, code, and write-up available for download at [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/qytj8/) and [*Environment and Planning B*](https://doi.org/10.1177/23998083221133112). Check out the interactive map below!

Zoom into a city and click on one of its HOLC neighborhoods to see its attributes. You can toggle the basemap by clicking the layer icon on the lefthand side. All variables used to populate these attribute tables are available [here](https://osf.io/28vup/).
