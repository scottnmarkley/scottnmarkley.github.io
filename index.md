I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Geography](https://geography.uga.edu/) at the University of Georgia. My research focuses on questions at the intersection of sub/urban geography and racial capitalism. This frequently involves multi-method investigations into housing segregation and the racially uneven geographies of sub/urban development. I also like to produce GIS data products that assist researchers and organizations working on similar questions.

My current project looks into the federal, New Deal-era ["redlining" mapping program](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=4/40.886/-105.499&text=intro) operated by the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC). Specifically, I position this program within the longer histories of racial capitalism, highlighting their role in linking race and value together in geographic space. As part of this effort, I have tabulated the variables in the HOLC maps' accompanying "Area Description" sheets. This rich historical data source contains detailed qualitative and quantitative information about each neighborhoods' racial and demographic, socioeconomic, housing, and locational characteristics. I have made the tabulated description sheet data available for download [here](https://osf.io/qytj8/). You can access the R code used to create these tables [here](https://github.com/snmarkley1/HOLC_ADS) and the preprint describing the background and methods [here](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dktah/).
