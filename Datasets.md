This page provides a centralized place to download to some of the datasets I have helped create, including the Historical Housing Unit and Urbanization Database v2010 (HHUUD10), the Tabulated HOLC Area Description Sheets (THOLCADS), and Tracts by Census Place Using Centroid.

HHUUD10 provides historical housing unit counts and urbanization estimates in consistent tract boundaries for the entire United States for each decade from 1940 to 2010 plus 2019.

### [THOLCADS on OSF](https://osf.io/qytj8/)

THOLCADS provides tabulated Area Description sheet data from the Home Owners' Loan Corporation's (HOLC) Residential Security maps.
