My ongoing dissertation project studies the New Deal-era HOLC mapping program. This initiative&mdash;officially called the "City Survey Program"&mdash;was instituted by the US federal government during the mid-1930s to map and grade thousands of neighborhoods in over 200 cities across the country (**see images below**). The infamous A-to-D grading system used to generate the maps reflected dominant ideas within the real-estate industry about how various neighborhood features impacted the investment potential of its residential properties. Among other demographic, socioeconomic, and locational characteristics, the visible presence of Black and non-white immigrants factored heavily in the grading process.
